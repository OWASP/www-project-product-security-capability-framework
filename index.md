## The OWASP Product Security Capabilities Framework (PSCF) 
This is the OWASP framework for building security capabilities into your product delivery process and teams. The framework currently consists of six (6) process areas and thirty-two (32) capabilities. 

The current 1.0 version of the framework is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GiQSePaFkY-wFj3RP3VUkZA81Pqzyhn9x78fSL2OTk8/edit#gid=0) in Google Sheets and anyone with an @owasp.org email address can comment.

The Sheet allows someone to do an assessment of their own organisation's capabilities and get a report.
